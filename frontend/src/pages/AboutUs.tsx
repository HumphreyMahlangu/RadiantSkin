          <h1>Skincare that respects your skin's story</h1>
          <p>
            We started RadiantSkin to make honest, effective skin, body, and
            hair care simple — no guesswork, no filler ingredients, just results
            you can feel.
          </p>

            <span className="eyebrow">Our Story</span>
            <h2 className="section-title">Built from a simple frustration</h2>
            <p>
              RadiantSkin began when our founder couldn't find skincare that was
              both gentle and genuinely effective — most products promised
              results but delivered irritation instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we set out to build our own line: dermatologist-tested
              formulas, transparent ingredient lists, and packaging that doesn't
              cost the earth. Every product carries that same standard today.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a single serum has grown into a full range across
              skin, body, and hair — trusted by thousands who wanted skincare
              that simply works.
